# Grutto
A website to store and find personal recipes


#### Rough outline
Have a flat .json file as 'database' that contains a list of recipe objects. Each recipe has the following fields:
* name (text)
* recipe (entire text of the recipe)
* ingredients (object that contains key-value pairs where the keys are ingredients and the values are the quantity

For a basic version we would need two main features:
1) Add a recipe by filling in the above fields
2) Display a list of all recipes by name, click on it to show the recipe
